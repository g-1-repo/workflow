```

### `workflow status`

Show project and workflow status.

## 🏗️ Programmatic Usage

Use as a library in your Node.js applications:

```typescript
import { createReleaseWorkflow, createTaskEngine, createWorkflow, quickRelease } from '@g-1/workflow'

// Quick release with interactive prompts
await quickRelease({ type: 'minor' })

// Custom workflow (note: createReleaseWorkflow is now async)
const steps = await createReleaseWorkflow({
  skipTests: true,
  nonInteractive: true, // Skip prompts for programmatic use
  skipCloudflare: true,
  skipNpm: true
})
const engine = createTaskEngine({ showTimer: true })
const result = await engine.execute(steps)

// Build custom workflows
const customWorkflow = createWorkflow('deploy')
  .step('Build', async (ctx, helpers) => {
    helpers.setOutput('Building application...')
    // Your build logic
  })
  .step('Deploy', async (ctx, helpers) => {
    helpers.setOutput('Deploying to production...')
    // Your deploy logic
  })
  .build()
```

## ⚙️ Configuration *(Coming Soon)*

Create `.go-workflow.config.js` in your project root:

```javascript
export default {
  project: {
    type: 'library', // 'library' | 'cli' | 'web-app' | 'api'
    packageManager: 'bun' // 'bun' | 'npm' | 'yarn' | 'pnpm'
  },

  git: {
    defaultBranch: 'main',
    branchNaming: {
      feature: 'feature/{name}',
      bugfix: 'bugfix/{name}',
      hotfix: 'hotfix/{name}'
    }
  },

  deployments: {
    npm: {
      enabled: true,
      access: 'public'
    },
    cloudflare: {
      enabled: true,
      buildCommand: 'npm run build'
    }
  },

  github: {
    autoRelease: true,
    pullRequests: {
      autoMerge: true,
      deleteBranch: true
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Node.js**: >= 18.0.0
- **Git**: For version control operations
- **GitHub CLI** *(optional)*: For GitHub integrations (`gh` command)
- **Wrangler** *(optional)*: For Cloudflare deployments

## 🏢 Enterprise Architecture

### **Core System Design**
This is an enterprise-grade TypeScript workflow automation tool with a modular architecture:

**Core Engine (`src/core/`)**
- `TaskEngine` - Native listr2 integration for beautiful progress UI, hierarchical tasks, concurrent execution support
- `GitStore` - Complete Git operations wrapper using simple-git, includes AI-powered suggestions for branch names and commit messages

**Workflow System (`src/workflows/`)**
- `ReleaseWorkflow` - Multi-stage release pipeline: Quality Gates → Git Operations → Deployments
- Declarative workflow definitions using WorkflowStep interface
- Extensible step system with subtasks, skip conditions, retry logic

**Plugin Architecture (`src/plugins/`)**
- Plugin system for custom workflow extensions
- Hook system for workflow events (before/after steps, error handling)

### **Key Architectural Patterns**

**Task Orchestration**
- Workflows are composed of WorkflowSteps with title, task function, subtasks
- TaskEngine converts these to native listr2 ListrTasks
- Context object flows between steps maintaining state

**Git-First Design**
- All operations are Git-aware with repository analysis
- Conventional commit parsing for semantic versioning
- Branch management with naming conventions (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)

**Enterprise Features**
- Quality gates enforced before any release (lint, typecheck, tests)
- Multi-platform deployment (npm, Cloudflare, GitHub releases)
- Fallback strategy: bun → npm → direct tools (bunx/npx)
- Interactive workflow with upfront configuration
- Crash-proof execution with error resilience

**Error Handling Strategy**
- **Interactive Error Recovery**: Uncommitted changes and deployment failures handled gracefully
- **Non-Fatal Deployments**: npm publish failures don't stop the workflow
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific guidance for authentication, permission, and OTP errors
- **Crash Prevention**: All interactive prompts moved upfront to prevent mid-workflow freezing
- **Custom Error Types**: WorkflowError, GitError, ConfigError, DeploymentError
- **Comprehensive Context**: Error context preserved throughout the workflow
